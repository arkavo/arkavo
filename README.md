(Upside of a hard name? I *always* get my username account when I want an online account)
- I’m interested in GPU computing and Solid State Physics (currently, I have a 2 year cycle).
- I’m currently a PhD student at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore working on 2D Magnetism.
- I've experience in C, C++, C#, python. I started coding from 2015. Generally working in computational physics.
I usually prefer working in C/C++ but I can probably work in any other language as well.
